SQL Lite Practice inclass6 <br>
Create a simple SQLLite application to keep track of banking accounts.  <br> 
These accounts have three characteristics: <br>
• ID – Identifies the account <br>
• Name – Who’s account this is <br>
• Type – i.e. savings, checking, etc. – this will be a string <br>
How to do it <br>
• Modify the contact.java file, or create it scratch, naming it bankAccount.java file. <br>
• Modify the DatabaseHandler.java file to reflect the bankAccount.java file  <br>
(i.e. put the correct fields in, change the getAllContacts method to be getAllAccounts, etc.). <br>
• Take the activity_main.xml file supplied and use that  <br>
(or cut and paste into your layout file) to get the controls that are needed.  <br> 
NOTE – if you built your project with content_main.xml and activity_main.xml, then this is your content_main.xml file. <br>
• Code your activity file. <br>
Notes <br>
There are two “output” controls, a textview and a listview.  <br>
Use the textview for the following button: <br>
• Get Number Of Accounts <br>
Use the listview for the following buttons. <br>
• Get Account By Name (because there could be a checking and savings for the same person) <br>
• Get All Accounts <br>
Code the Add button <br>
